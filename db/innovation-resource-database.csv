Proposals that bring together faculty from different departments and disciplines will be given priority consideration in funding decisions.

The main purpose of the grant is to generate group conversations at Berkeley that are led by faculty who find a particular theme intellectually compelling.  Applicants should consider an approach that would bring as wide a Berkeley community into the conversation as possible, and group members must come from at least two different departments.  The maximum number of faculty members per group is four, and groups should appoint a coordinator.  IIS will support a required bimonthly (twice a month) meeting of the group to which three outside speakers may be invited each semester.  Speaker travel will be funded by the grant from IIS.

Grantees are expected to attend all bimonthly meetings of the group.  Grantees must submit a finalized schedule of outside speakers to IIS at the beginning of the semester.  Any events (outside speaker lectures, conferences, etc.) should be free and open to the public.  The grants to any one group will not run for more than two years.  An evaluation of the colloquia will be carried out at the end of the first year to assess whether the second year should be supported.  Proposals should mention if the culmination of the series could result in the publication of a book, an edited volume, or a special issue of a journal, which may also be supported by IIS.",Funding & Grants,,,,Faculty,,UC Berkeley,Berkeley,,,4/2/2018,,$30k/yr,General,,BearX.co,2-page project narrative,,,,,,,,

Forté is creating the most comprehensive list of board-ready women with the goal of bringing attention to the lack of women on corporate boards.

Forté partners with leading business schools across the globe to identify women who are interested in advancing their careers and ultimately becoming Board eligible. To continue this effort, Forté member schools collectively are making a difference in the number of women on boards by supporting the board ready initiative. 

Forté has joined forces with the European Commission, the Financial Times and a host of other leading organizations and institutions to play a prominent role in identifying and promoting qualified senior female leadership. Forté Foundation is the US partner of the initiative and a member of the Task Force.

How to Apply: if you find that your background matches the Forté  Board Readiness criteria, you may be formally considered for the Global Board-Ready Women List.

Abstract
Television viewing and aggressive behavior were assessed over a 17-year interval in a community sample of 707 individuals. There was a significant association between the amount of time spent watching television during adolescence and early adulthood and the likelihood of subsequent aggressive acts against others. This association remained significant after previous aggressive behavior, childhood neglect, family income, neighborhood violence, parental education, and psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically.
